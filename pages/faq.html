          What is a Playroom?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>
            My counselling office has a large playroom where I see children for
            play therapy. The playroom provides a child-friendly environment
            equipped with a sandpit, painting easel, creative materials,
            puppets, dress up clothes, miniature figures and an extensive range
            of therapeutic toys. These toys are carefully selected to allow your
            child to play out themes of real life, safely express their feelings
            and allow creative expression. Play is the language of children, and
            when toys or play media are used, the item chosen by the child can
            communicate messages and feelings which can be difficult for the
            child to communicate verbally.

          What happens in a Play Therapy session?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>
            Play Therapy sessions last about 50 minutes because play therapy is
            hard work and for most children this is ample time to think about or
            experience different feelings. Sometimes if your child is anxious
            about leaving you, you and your child may come into the playroom
            together initially. When your child feels comfortable with you
            leaving the playroom, the rest of the session and following sessions
            are conducted with your child and myself only in the playroom. This
            allows your child to freely express their feelings and concerns
            without the worry of upsetting you. In Play Therapy your child
            selects the toys and activities to play with. The Play Therapist may
            join in the play with the child’s invitation or direction. In a
            typical play therapy session, the Play Therapist will be reflecting
            about how your child is engaging with toys and the underlying
            emotions which seem to accompany the actions rather than asking
            questions. Limits are set as and when needed. This is done in a way
            to help your child make choices and develop self responsibility.

          How do I prepare my child for their first Play Therapy session?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>
            Tell your child that they are going to play with a person called Fiona in a special playroom with lots of toys each week.  This is usually enough.  If your child wants to know more say “When things are hard for you at home (and/or school), sometimes it helps to have a special place to play.”  With older children I will spend some time with you present talking about the reason the child is coming to Play Therapy.

          What if my child won’t stay or settle in the playroom?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>
            Some children find it difficult to separate from their parent or caregiver.  Initially you may join your child in the playroom but not become involved in your child’s play.  Your presence will reassure your child about his or her new situation.  The Play Therapist will guide you and, when appropriate, suggest you leave the room.

          Do I need to wait whilst my child is in their Play Therapy session?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>
            Yes, it is important your child knows you are waiting in the waiting room and that we can come and check should he or she needs to do this. 

            Please feel free to make yourself comfortable and enjoy some time for yourself.
