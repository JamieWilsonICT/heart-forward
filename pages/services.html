          <h2>Intake Session</h2>
          <p>
            The first session is an intake conversation between myself and you
            (a child’s parent(s) or caregiver(s)). This is an opportunity for me
            to find out more about your child, your family and the concerns you
            have. It is also an opportunity for you to find out more about how I
            work with children and families, and to ask any questions you have.
            Allow up to 90 minutes for an Intake Session.
          </p>

          <h2>Therapy Sessions</h2>
          <p>
            Play therapy sessions between myself and a child occur once a week.
            In order to provide consistency, sessions occur on the same day and
            at the same time each week. Consistency helps children to feel
            secure and allows the momentum of progress to continue
            uninterrupted. The number of play therapy sessions needed varies
            from child to child. Each Play Therapy Session is approximately 50
            minutes.

          <h2>Review Sessions</h2>
          <p>
            Review meetings between myself and you will occur on a regular basis
            (usually after every 5 play therapy sessions) so we can exchange
            information about what’s been happening for your child at home and
            during play therapy. During these sessions I will also offer you
            guidance on what you can do to support your child. Each Review
            Session is approximately 50 minutes.

          <h2>Cost & Payment</h2>
          <p>
            Each session costs $125. This is reduced to $110 a session for a
            bundle of 5 Play Therapy Sessions and 1 Review Session (i.e. $660)
            if this payment is made in advance. Please note, Intake Sessions are
            not included in the bundle and cost $125. Payment is by internet
            banking.
